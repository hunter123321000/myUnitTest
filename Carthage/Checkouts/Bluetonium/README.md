## Requirements

## Installation
### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)
Add the following to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```rb
pod 'Bluetonium'
```

Make sure that you are integrating your dependencies using frameworks: add `use_frameworks!` to your Podfile. Then run `pod install`.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
Add the following to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

```
github "e-sites/Bluetonium"
```

Run `carthage update` and follow the steps as described in Carthage's [README](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).


## Usage

### Get devices

The `Manager` will handle searching for devices and connecting to them.
```swift
import Bluetonium

let manager = Manager()
manager.delegate = self
manager.startScanForDevices()
```

If a device is found you will get notified by the `func manager(manager: Manager, didFindDevice device: Device)` delegate call. You can also get all found devices in the `foundDevices` array of your manager.

### Connect to a device

Connecting to a device is simple.

```swift
manager.connectWithDevice(device)
```

The `device` is a device form the `foundDevices` array.

### Create and register a ServiceModel

A `ServiceModel` subclass will represents a Service, all the properties represent the Characteristics.

This example represents the [Battery Service](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.battery_service.xml)

```swift
class BatteryServiceModel: ServiceModel {

	var batteryLevel: UInt8 = 0
	
	override func serviceUUID() -> String {
		return "180F"
	}
	
	override func mapping(map: Map) {
		batteryLevel <- map["2A19"]
	}
	
}
```

Register a `ServiceModel` subclass. Make sure you do this before the device is actualy connected.

```swift
let batteryServiceModel = BatteryServiceModel()

func manager(manager: Manager, willConnectToDevice device: Device) {
	device.registerServiceModel(batteryServiceModel)
}
```

---

### ServiceModel subclass

A `ServiceModel` subclass will represents a Service, all the properties represent the Characteristics.
Interacting with the peripheral is only possible once the characteristic did became available through the `func characteristicBecameAvailable(withUUID UUID: String)` function.  
Or when the `serviceReady` boolean is set to `true`.

It's recommended to create a struct containing static properties of the UUID's along with your `ServiceModel` this way your app doesn't have to hardcode the UUID in different places and prevents errors. (See example: HeartRateServiceModel in project)

#### Reading
```swift
batteryServiceModel.readValue(withUUID: "2A19")

// Or with completion
batteryServiceModel.readValue(withUUID: "2A19") { value in
	print(value)
}
```

#### Writing
```swift
batteryServiceModel.batteryLevel = 10
batteryServiceModel.writeValue(withUUID: "2A19")
```

#### Custom DataTransformers

It is possible that your characteristic has a custom data format or has a data format not yet supported. Then you can create your own custom DataTransformer for that property.

The custom DataTransformer needs to conform to the `DataTransformer` protocol which has two functions.

```swift
class HeartRateDataTransformer: DataTransformer {
    
    func transform(dataToValue data: NSData?) -> MapValue {
    	// Used when reading from the characteristic.
    	// Transform NSData to your property MapValue.
    }
    
    func transform(valueToData value: MapValue?) -> NSData {
    	// Used when writing to the characteristic.
    	// Transform your property MapValue to NSData.
    }
    
}
```

To register your custom DataTransform you can add it to the mapping function:

```swift
func mapping(map: Map) {
	heartRate <- (map["2A37"], HeartRateDataTransformer())
}
```

#### Set notifications for a characteristic

The `ServiceModel` has a function that will let you register for value changes on the peripheral. When you return `true` for one of you characteristics it will automatically update the property.

```swift
func registerNotifyForCharacteristic(withUUID UUID: String) -> Bool
```
